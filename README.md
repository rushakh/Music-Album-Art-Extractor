A simple Console app written in C# for extracting and saving album / cover arts of music files (Local). Has Batch Mode and Single Song Mode, and saves the images. 

It was part of the music player that I was writing but decided to turn this part into a seperate app, though it is a very simple one at that. Nevertheless, I thought that it might be useful to someone out there.

You can either compile it yourself or download the single file that I've uploaded.

Written in .Net 8
Used ATL /atldotnet (z440.atl.core) by @Zeugma440 that you can find here https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet
which made my life alot simpler in my other app as well as this one.

If you find any issue or have any suggestions let me know. Enjoy
